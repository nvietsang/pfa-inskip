# PFA-INSKIP

Supporting code for the paper [Practical Persistent Fault Attacks on AES with Instruction Skip](https://cic.iacr.org/p/2/1/40).

## Overview

- `expfrcon`: experiment for the differential fault attack via instruction skip in the round constant generation. Conducted on a ChipWhisperer Lite integrated with 32-bit STM32F303 target.
- `expfsbox`: experiment for the persistent fault attack via instruction skip in the S-box generation. Conducted on a ChipWhisperer Lite integrated with 32-bit STM32F303 target.
- `simfrcon`: simulation for the differential fault attack via instruction skip in the round constant generation.
- `simfsbox`: simulation for the persistent fault attack via instruction skip in the S-box generation.
